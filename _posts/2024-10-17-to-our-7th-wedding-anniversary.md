excerpt: So many happy memories are about you, occupying a significant part of my life. You are my wife, and what’s more, my soulmate. I cannot imagine how dim my life would be without you. I hope to be a better husband, to weather whatever comes our way, and to make the rest of our lives peaceful and happy.

Let the time machine take us back ten years, to the place I always love, to the moment when two independent souls connected. I never could have imagined our lives would merge like they have, or that we would end up married. You have been the most important and enduring relationship of my life, and you inspire me to be a better person than I ever thought I could be. I feel freer, more joyful, and more able to transcend myself. Thank God for bringing you to me.

Huizhou culture is our Cupid. Huizhou, this stunning area, is my dream place. Though your hometown is familiar to you, I feel it’s almost like my true home as well. I love the pure water of the streams, the lush green mountains, and the kind people who live in their aesthetic dwellings. I could never forget the scene when we were talking along the mountain path, looking up at the fantastic Milky Way, without worrying about how dark the night had been.

I’ve learned so much from you, your family, and the environment you grew up in. Every time we spend almost half a year in your hometown, it always brings me a sense of peace. I enjoy working there and playing all day with you. Sometimes I imagine that if we weren’t living abroad, I would like to spend our remaining years in your hometown when we are old.

Seven years of marriage is a significant milestone in Chinese culture, often referred to as the "seven-year itch," which suggests that many couples may experience challenges around this time. But for me, this is not a concern, just a beginning of our lives. Though we also have disagreements from time to time, thank goodness we are both rational and take the initiative to resolve various problems.

You always say that there are so many amazing things while you live with me. I truly appreciate that I can bring you that feeling, and I will continue to prevent any tediousness from appearing in our lives. I believe that with our memories, whichever one of us goes to heaven first, the one left behind will have the rest of their life filled with happiness, even though who goes first is a brutal reality.

Osmanthus blossoms now, and the pleasant aroma permeates the autumn wind, occasionally wafting to my nose. This always makes me recollect the time when the same aroma floated into the bus from the osmanthus plants by the side of the road when I first came to your hometown. You are the incarnation of this special flower, making my soul stable and my heart warmer.

So many happy memories are about you, occupying a significant part of my life. You are my wife, and what’s more, my soulmate. I cannot imagine how dim my life would be without you. I hope to be a better husband, to weather whatever comes our way, and to make the rest of our lives peaceful and happy.I will always hug you, until our hair turns white and until the end of life.

Happy 7th Wedding Anniversary, my darling, my lil bunny!
