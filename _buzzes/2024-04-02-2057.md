I was confused about the relation between "Public Hostname" and "Private Network" when using Cloudflare Zero Trust. Actually, they are independent. The former is easy to explain, while the latter requires attention to two things: setting the real and existing subnet, and setting up 'Split Tunnels' to exclude the subnet. Thus, you can access the subnet as if you are at home, which is super handy!
