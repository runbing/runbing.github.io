HomeBrew has implemented [Externally Managed Environments](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments/#externally-managed-environments) for Python, making it mandatory for users to use a virtual environment. If you want to install a package system-wide or just for current user with `pip` as before, you must append the flag `--break-system-packages` to avoid the externally-managed-environment error. For example, `pip install requests --user --break-system-packages`. I do not like this change.
