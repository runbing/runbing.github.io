I requested to move my Amazon SNS account from the sandbox to production, but my application was denied twice in a row. Out of curiosity, I asked how I could get it approved. After waiting nearly 24 hours, I received a response stating that my request had been approved and my sending limit was increased from 200 to 50,000 messages, with the rate raised from 1 to 14 messages per second. Was everything handled by a bot before? Iâ€™m not complaining about Amazon, but I do dislike how spammers have led to such strict limitations being imposed on regular users.
