I was confused about the relation between "[Public Hostname](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/routing-to-tunnel/)" and "[Private Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/)" when using Cloudflare Zero Trust. Actually, they are independent. The former is easy to explain and the usage is also straightforward, while the latter requires attention to two things: setting the subnet that exists in a real environment, and setting up "Split Tunnels" to exclude the subnet. Thus, you can access the subnet as if you are at home, which is super handy!
